Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: person("Thoralf", "Mildenberger", email = "mild@zhaw.ch", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Implementation of uniformly most powerful invariant equivalence
    tests for one- and two-sample problems (paired and unpaired) as described 
    in Wellek (2010, ISBN:978-1-4398-0818-4). Also one-sided alternatives 
    (non-inferiority and non-superiority tests) are supported. Basically a variant 
    of a t-test with (relaxed) null and alternative hypotheses exchanged.
