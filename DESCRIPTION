Title: Uniformly Most Powerful Invariant Tests of Equivalence
Version: 0.0.0.9011
Authors@R: person("Thoralf", "Mildenberger", email = "mild@zhaw.ch", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Implementation of uniformly most powerful invariant equivalence
    tests for one- and two-sample problems (paired and unpaired). Also
    one-sided alternatives (non-inferiority and non-superiority tests) are
    supported. Basically a variant of a t-test with (relaxed) null and
    alternative hypotheses exchanged.
